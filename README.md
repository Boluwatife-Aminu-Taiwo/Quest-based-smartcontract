# Quest-based smart contract in Web3

### This is the backend(blockchain) of the quest-based app. This smart contract allows users to join and submit quest. It also allows the admin or creator to set up as the owner of the contract and create quests.

## Tools

# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```

## possible improvements

1. make it a fully automative app on web3 that allows admin set a task and allows users participate and also reward the participation
2. design it as an employer-employee interaction where employees do task given be the employers.
